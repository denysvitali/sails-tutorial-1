## A Simple Sails Tutorial

I had some down time and was looking for a rapid prototyping system that would help
me quickly evolve backend ReST services.  Sails looked very promising for this purpose.
I figured in addition to playing around with Sails, I'd also document the process in
the form of some simple tutorials.  Taking the extra time to try to explain things
always helps me refine my own thought processes, as well as gaining the extra
benefit of documenting things for later use.

I intend on tagging the project at each point so you can see the changes that
were made.

Each successive tutorial is located in TUTORIALS/TUTORIALXX.md.

Hope you enjoy them and happy sailing!
